// Pretty much every application is going to need to do something with navigation and routes handling. 
// Since React doesn't include routing mechanism we will use additional library named 'react-router'. 
// As you can see in this application there is already Routing defined and on each exercise the path in the browser 
// changes accordingly. 
// If you open App.js component you can see that our whole application is wrapped in </BrowserRouter> component provided by 'react-router' library.

// Exercise: 
//   Create a Routes component that will define a </Route> for '/edit-note' and </Route> for '/create-note'.
//   This Routes component besides the Routes also needs to include </Link> in order to navigate to your defined </Route> 
//   When user clicks on "Create Note" or "Edit Note" </Link>, we need to render the </CreateNote> or </EditNote>  component defined bellow.
//   Make sure that you use the current path '/exercise/routes-handling' when defining your custom Routes.
